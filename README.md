# VS Code Extension Lister

This extension gathers all your active, non-theme and non-builtin extensions and exports them to a list in the following format for easy sharing:

`<extension name>: <extension marketplace url>`

This extension serves as an example for building a functional extension for Visual Studio Code. Please see the corresponding post that steps through building it from scratch: [Visual Studio Code Extension Development](https://dev.to/azure/building-a-visual-studio-code-extension-dkj)
